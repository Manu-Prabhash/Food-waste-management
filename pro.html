            <p class="content">Food waste (FW) related issues in developing countries is currently considered to be a major threatening factor for sustainable development and FW management systems. Due to incomplete FW management systems, many developing countries are facing challenges, such as environmental and sanitary problems that are caused by FW. The difference in FW generation trends between developing countries and developed countries was reviewed in this work, which demonstrated that the effects of income level, population growth, and public participation in FW management are very important. Thus, this work aimed to provide an overview of recycling activities, related regulations, and current FW treatment technology in developing countries by following some case studies. Taiwan, has been suggested as being a successful case in terms of FW management, and is therefore a typical model for developing countries to follow. Finally, an integrative management system as a suitable model for FW management has been suggested for developing countries.</p>

            <p class="content">In India, the larger the marriage, the larger the party, and also the additional stupendous the waste. No doubt weddings and banquets are an enormous supply 
                of food wastage, however, restaurants and hotels conjointly contribute to food wastage, although the attention around this has grown full-grown within the last 5 years.
                 Whereas some restaurants in India use food controllers to envision food spoilage, alternatives give it to their employees and other personnel, and smaller standalone
                  restaurants, give it to orphanages. Few utilize non-perishable food.</p>

                  <p class="one"><strong>Food waste findings:</stong></p>
                  <p class="two">On Average, 40% of food produced were being disposed of. This means that 7.5 tons of food are discarded daily.
                    Some 84.7% of the whole waste material recorded was thrown within the bin, whereas the remainder was either fed to the poor or some animals.
                   A big portion of the waste material binned was still in edible condition.
                   If the edible waste material generated is used, we tend to estimate that it might feed a minimum of 2000 individuals daily.
                   Solely a pair of the ten shops surveyed were part waste aware, i.e., they separated the edible from the inedible, and ensured that food in condition reached empty stomachs. One among them disposed of their food at twelve noon, in order that it might be fed to the cows within the space. The other claimed to administer away all edible waste material to the native laborers and employees, for free, at the tip of the day.
                   Overall, we tend to conclude that, across the town, an absence of consciousness around waste material is obvious. It is true that the difficulty of food waste management in India is far additional nonmoving within the actual handling, storage, and transport of food grains and vegetables before they even reach the consumer’s plate. However, the matter of waste material at the retail level cannot be unnoticed, particularly once 7.5 tons of food is wasted per day, that too solely.</p>

                    <p class="one"><strong>solutions for food waste management in India</strong></p>
                    <p class="two">For an efficient way of food waste management in India luckily, business owners involved in the food production and manufacturing sector, there are various viable solutions prepared at hand. Here are a number of the foremost common and handiest ways to scale back or manage waste matter levels in your business:<br>

                        Recycle by Composting:<br> Food producers will solve 100% of their waste matter issues by merely organizing a good composting strategy. And doing therefore not solely eliminates waste, it saves you cash as a result of you don’t have to be compelled to “outsource” your compost production.
                        
                        Turn Wasted Food into Animal Feed:<br> Cultivating compost is a method to recycle food, however it also can be drained of the bellies of cows, sheep, pigs, and alternative ethereal (themselves destined to become food).
                        
                        Use Waste Food to provide Products:<br> From biofuels to liquid fertilizer, there are several helpful merchandises that may be factory-made from bound styles of waste foods, and infrequently “leftovers” of one company might be helpful in another business for the food scrap.
                        
                        Source Reduction and Food Donation:<br The easiest method to curtail waste matter is to easily turn out less whenever production is clearly resulting in waste. Once excess foodstuffs are still safe to eat, there will be hungry and poor people who realize it troublesome to afford decent food in today’s dear economy.</p>

                            <p class="one"><steong>Waste management hierarchy</steong></p>
                            <p class="two">The waste management hierarchy is an approach that focuses on prioritizing waste management practices with the goal to achieve sustainable waste management. It establishes the order of waste management options, from the most preferred to the least preferred one:<br>

                                Prevention <br>
                                Minimization<br>
                                Reuse<br>
                                Recycling<br>
                                Disposal <br>
                                
                                
                                Besides many other actions that can be taken, the simplest most preferable practice, and often the least costly option, is the prevention of waste at the source. A good example regarding food service establishments is reducing portion sizes at restaurants and cafeterias, this will consequently reduce the amount of food waste in this sector. If waste generation cannot be completely prevented, the next step is to minimize the amount of waste produced.
                                
                                Reusing products or materials that are still in good condition is another preferred option. This can involve repairing, refurbishing, or repurposing items to extend their lifespan and avoid the need for new production.
                                
                                Recycling involves the processing of waste materials to create new products. It is an important method to recover valuable resources from waste. Various recycling technologies and processes are utilized to convert waste into raw materials for manufacturing.
                                
                                Lastly, despite the fact that it is the least preferable waste management option, disposal or landfilling is the option used when none of the above methods could be used. Food waste generated from leftover perished produce and spoiled food is the number one material taking up landfill space. Proper landfill management practices are essential to minimize environmental impacts.</p>
